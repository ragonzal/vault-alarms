# ðŸ”’ Safe Vaults ðŸ”’

My project for ETHOnline 2020

## Description
The project consists of a native iOS application to track Vaults from the Maker Protocol. The goal was to build a small, simple and visually attractive app that can alert users when a sudden drop in the vault collateral price happened, so that they can act before getting liquidated.
